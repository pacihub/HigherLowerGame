# HigherLowerGame

A simplified version of the Higher Or Lower game: http://www.higherlowergame.com/

Two instagram accounts are pulled out randomly out of a database, and the player must guess which one has more followers.
If the player guesses right, a point is added to their score and they continue guessing. The next guess is between the winning account from previous one and a newly picked one.

The player loses as soon as they guess wrong and their score is printed on the screen along with the instagram followers' count of the accounts they tried to guess.
